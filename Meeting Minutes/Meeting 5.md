# Week 5
# This Week's Summary
## 1. Complete the requirements form

## 2. Work summary for last week

  ### Code review
It can be done using LLama3, but the workload and feasibility are uncertain. There are few open projects on GitHub for Llama's code review.
  ### Code auto-modification
Code standardization and code review, C++ open-source tools, the feasibility of large language models is low. 

  - https://github.com/akof1314/CoolFormat  - Last updated six years ago.      
    Corresponding CSDN article: https://blog.csdn.net/akof1314/article/details/5355948 
    
 -  https://github.com/prettier/prettier - Does not change variable names, only modifies formatting, and is only for JavaScript.
  
### Code explanation Website-style code explanation and comments
    
### Code completion 
- https://github.com/val-town/codemirror-codeium  - Based on Codeium for code completion, supporting multiple languages. 
- https://github.com/microsoft/PyCodeGPT - Can it complete Python? However, the cost of training the model is very high.

### Code rewriting
- **Babel**: A command-line tool that can translate code from one programming language to another. It supports multiple languages including Python, Java, C#, and JavaScript.
- **Transcoder**: A Python library that can translate code between different programming languages.
- **Rewriter**: A Python library that can rewrite code from one programming language to another.
- **Code Transformator**: An open-source library for converting code. It supports various languages including Java, Python, C++, and C#.
